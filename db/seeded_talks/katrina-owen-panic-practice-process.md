# Panic, Practice, Process

If I'm worrying about how I'm doing, I'm not paying attention to what I'm doing.

I'm not the only person in the tech industry that panics. How many people rush to learn everything. It's overwhelming. You meet a stack trace you don't understand and you paste the Google or the SO snippet and you sudo it.

If you give yourself until breakfast to save the world, come breakfast time either you're going to be extremely frustrated by your lack of progress or you'll have cut so many corners that the world might looked saved but its not.

The key to escaping this is FOCUS. Slow down, stop rushing. Declare learning bankruptcy. Let's be honest here, you won't be needing it. If you find out that you do need it, you're in luck because "just in time" learning kicks "just in case" learning's butt every time.

When you find a repeatable process and then focus on that process than your progress, something magical happens. You begin absorbed in what you're doing. Being awesome feels effortless. This is the zone.

The zone is halfway between the Panic Zone and the Comfort Zone. The Panic Zone is exciting, but your higher level functions stop. The Comfort Zone is where passions die.

Focus, repetition, instantaneous feedback = flow.

The Dreyfus Model:

- Novice: You just follow the rules.
- Advanced Beginner: You see the details, not the condition.
- Competent: They can do troubleshooting and productive stuff here. You get to this comfort zone.
- Proficient: Here, everything becomes nuanced. You start seeing underlying patterns and you apply overarching principles.
- Expert: The expert sees 1,000 details but they skip 999 of them.

Focus, repetition, instantaneous feedback: This is how you go to the next level.

Don't do what you love. Do something enough to love what you do.
