# RailsConf 2012: Progress by David Heinemeier Hansson

It's not interesting to talk about the progress that we all agree on. The thing that makes us interested in progress is the things that we disagree on

-  REST was an issue in 2006, people thought routes was bad and we had to rely on controllers.
- Ruby 1.9, hassle to rewrite software?
- Bundler
- Rails 3
- Asset pipeline
- Coffeescript

It usually comes down to "the old one was better".

But the good thing is that in software development, we can really prove if things are better or not.

Ex: `Person.find(:conditions => {:name => "David"})` improved to `Person.where(name: "David")`.

Skepticism is OK. What I don't think is when you switch from becoming curious of new things to being suspicious of new things.
