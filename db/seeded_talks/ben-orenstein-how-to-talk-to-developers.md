# Ben Orenstein - RailsConf 2013 - How to Talk to Developers

Law of Demeter is structural duplication. Don't encode application structure in the code.

Calisthenics + Live demonstration. This is setting the tone. "My name is Ben Orenstein, I work at thoughtbot and I would like all of you to stand up." So on the first sentence, there is already something happening.

Thesis right away: It is more important to be entertaining rather than informative. If you can't hold people's attention, there's a problem. You have to be good, because are fighting against the entire Internet.

People love the story they know.

The first sentence is high-level, same with first paragraph. The dependencies point upward. This is so that the editor can cut the piece at any point and have the article.

Show, don't tell. Relative numbers. Plus to move to first non-whitespace. Leader commands :) Try not to leave the editor. Then go and read the help.txt.

Live actions are usually better. Live coding is more interesting than code on a slide.

Body language: Arms bent and open 90 degrees.

Local variables: Capital letter. Globals: lower-case + number.

People like stories. People like stories that are embarassing. This is why TheDailyWTF is popular.

First, nerves. Just think of it as something that happens. So I start my talk with calisthenics, partly for me.

Doctor can give you beta blockers. They dull your response to Fight or Flight.

Amy Cuddy Ted talk on Power poses. Fake it to make it true.

Talk nerves: Every talk you have a nodder who just randomly nods. Then when you are in a panic, just talk with the nodder.

Don't give things about things you don't really care about. Good information, impassionate delivery.

Don't pre-apologize. Don't set expectations low.

How to ask for questions: "You guys get this, right?" Right way: "Let's have some questions." Then pause for five seconds. Put your hands behind your back.

First, don't talk first on the last day. Don't put new speakers on those slots. Ask for smaller rooms.

Singing (lol): Pick a starting pitch. Start on the same key. When you stand up, chest out.
